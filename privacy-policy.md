# Narratif Privacy Policy

This Privacy Policy describes how Narratif (the "App") operates regarding the collection, use, and disclosure of information.

**Narratif is designed with your privacy in mind. We do not collect, store, or transmit any personal data or personally identifiable information from our users.**

## 1. Information We Do Not Collect

Narratif is a local-only application. This means:
* **No Personal Information:** We do not collect any personal data such as your name, email address, location, device identifiers, or any other information that could identify you.
* **No Usage Data:** We do not track your usage patterns, what stories you generate, or how often you use the app.
* **No Analytics:** We do not use any third-party analytics services that might collect data from your device.
* **No Data Transmission:** The App does not transmit any data to our servers or any third-party servers.

## 2. Information Generated and Stored Locally

The App generates text-based stories based on your input (factions, battlefield, terrain).
* **Locally Stored Content:** All stories you create are generated and stored exclusively on your device. We do not have access to this content.
* **No Sensitive Content Generation:** The App is designed to generate narrative stories for a tabletop game context. It does not generate content related to violence, sex, drug abuse, or any other inappropriate themes.

## 3. How We Use Information (N/A)

Since we do not collect any user information, we have no information to use.

## 4. Data Retention (Local Only)

All data (generated stories) is retained only on your device for as long as you choose to keep the App installed and the data is not manually deleted by you. If you uninstall the App, all locally stored data will be removed.

## 5. Third-Party Services

Narratif does not integrate with any third-party services that would collect user data (e.g., advertising networks, analytics providers).

## 6. Children's Privacy

Narratif is designed for general audiences and is suitable for users of all ages interested in the Warhammer 40,000 tabletop game. Given that we do not collect any personal information, we do not knowingly collect personal information from children under the age of 13. If you are a parent or guardian and you believe that your child has provided us with personal information, please contact us so that we can take appropriate action.

## 7. Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page. You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes. Changes to this Privacy Policy are effective when they are posted on this page.
